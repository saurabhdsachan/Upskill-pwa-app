      'I really like the design! It really feels warm and cozy even with the amount of grey that is currently in there. Funny enough, I have had my eye on that rug for such a long time and you used it in the design without knowing that, lol. I have also already bought the coffee table! and plan on buying most all things on there. My style has really changed over the years and I feel like this captures just the design I was looking for. Thank you so much for designing my space!',

      'We gotta tell you about this room!!! So we wanted some ideas on designing and decorating our baby nursery! So we looked around and decided to use this awesome company Spacejoy We took some pictures of our room and they made a replica of our unique room and designed it on our interests and opinions. It was so easy and they were so great to work with. Next time you need a fresh new look or a total redesign you have to check out Spacejoy out and find joy in your space!!',

      "We decided to give Spacejoy a try and so glad we did. Couldn't be happier with how the room turned out - It's exactly the style we were going for but could never quite achieve. The process was easy  and fun, we also ended up doing our living room a little later. Spacejoy was able to seamlessly integrate out current furniture with the new designs. Will never paint or buy furnishing for another room without getting a design from Spacejoy first.",

From the technology that was able to render my apt to a tee, to the personalized 1:1 moments working with my designer Lauren, the whole experience was worth while. Lauren incorporated everything I said I needed and wanted I can’t believe my apt looks as amazing as it does. Can’t wait to update and utilize the space!',

Our designer, Sarah completely matched the designs to our style and vision and was very responsive to all of our questions.

We wouldn’t hesitate to hire Spacejoy again for all of our interior design needs!',

Being able to see our room transformed in 3D made it so easy to decide on the design concept that best suited our style. The process is super simple, the team is quick and responsive and the overall results were impressive. Thank you Spacejoy!',
