          Pep is a small but dedicated team of interior designers, 3D artists, developers, and other superstars who
          handle several miscellaneous tasks. Our team is passionate about all things design, and we aim to offer the
          best experience to you through our interior designs and products. That said, if you’re here reading our refund
          policy, it means there’s a glitch. We think everything can be resolved with an open and honest conversation.
          <br />
          Please write to us at <a href="mailto:hello@Pep.com">hello@Pep.com</a>, and your design assistants will make
          every effort to turn things around. Our aim is to make sure your experience with us is as amazing as possible.
          However, if you think there is nothing we can do to fix the situation, read on to see how our refund policy
          works.

          If you placed an order for a design package on Pep by mistake and are not ready to get started on your design
          yet, you&apos;re entitled to a full refund. Provided you request a refund within 48 hours of placing the
          order. Why? A designer is assigned to your project as soon as you place the order. Within the first 48 hours,
          your designer does a lot of groundwork to prepare your design. If you cancel the order within the first 48
          hours, we can notify your designer, so they do not continue to do any extra work. (Aren&apos;t we all bummed
          when that happens?).

        <h3 className="text-lg mb-2">Not happy with your design concepts?</h3>
        <p className="text-base text-gray-500">
          Pep&apos;s team of online interior designers are experts and absolute professionals, and as that, we take a
          lot of pride in our design team. However, sometimes, we all have off days (happens to the best of us). If you
          feel the final designs your designer delivered lacks the vision you have for your space, we can offer you a
          full refund on your design fee. However before we refund, our claims team will get in touch with you to
          understand what went wrong and will have the final authority on approving the claim. If your design is in the
          re-design phase and you think there is a mismatch between you and your designer, we’ll try and match you with
          a new designer to correct the course. If you don’t want to go down that route and simply want a refund, then
          our claims team will verify and decide a fair percentage of your design fee that can be refunded. Please note
          that the 100% money-back guarantee reimbursement will only apply for your Pep design package within the first
          thirty days of purchase.

          In the scenario where you paid for a design package on Pep and completely lost track of it because there were
          other pressing matters to tend to, don’t worry, your design credit is safe with us. You can choose to come
          back and kickstart your project when you have the time at hand, within a year. We’ll also knock at your door a
          month before your order expires on Pep to check if you’re ready to design with us. If you’re still not
          available, we’ll store it as store credits for you to redeem it on Pep later.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-gray-500">
          In the scenario where you started a project and forgot all about it before we were to deliver the final design
          concepts, we will make several attempts to catch your attention and nudge you back to your project ( we
          understand shiny object syndrome). However, if we don’t hear back from you, then in 30 days, your project will
          be tagged inactive. Your order remains with us. You can come back at a later date and pick up where you left
          off. Your designer, however, will move on to a different project because- duty beckons. When you decide to
          restart, write to us at hello@Pep.com and we will re-assign your project to an expert designer.

        <p className="text-base text-gray-500">
          We offer multiple redesigns to make sure you fall in love with your new space. Make sure to send in your
          feedback with design changes within 30 days of receiving your latest design concept. If we don&apos;t hear
          from you within 30 days, your designer will close your project. If you, however, want to request changes after
          30 days, your request will undergo a review before we can commit.
